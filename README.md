### üìã SmartLists & List Types

WatchBuddy offers six powerful list types to match different discovery needs:

#### **Custom Lists**
Manually curated lists where you have full control. Perfect for watchlists, collections, or sharing with friends.
- Add/remove titles manually
- Set custom filters and ordering
- Optionally sync to Trakt

#### **Suggested Lists**
Pre-configured recommendation lists with optimized filters for popular use cases.
- "Hidden Gems" - Highly rated but lesser-known titles
- "Recent Blockbusters" - Mainstream hits from the last 2 years
- "Cult Classics" - Beloved niche favorites
- One-click setup with proven filter combinations

#### **Mood Lists**
Emotionally-driven recommendations that match your current feeling.
- Select up to 3 moods (Dark, Cozy, Tense, Quirky, Feel-Good, etc.)
- Mood vector scoring weights genres and themes appropriately
- Perfect for "I want something dark and intense tonight"

#### **Theme Lists**
Curated around specific topics, settings, or concepts.
- Time Travel, Space Exploration, Heist Movies, etc.
- Combines genre filters with keyword matching
- Semantic search finds thematically similar content

#### **Fusion Lists**
Blend multiple genres together for unique combinations.
- "Rom-Com Thrillers" (Romance + Comedy + Thriller)
- "Sci-Fi Horror" (Science Fiction + Horror)
- Automatic genre weighting finds the best crossover titles

#### **Chat Lists** ‚≠ê *Most Powerful*
Natural language prompts powered by smart parsing - just describe what you want!

**Examples:**
- *"Cozy feel-good movies like The Hangover, prefer stuff after 2000, comedies with a bit of action"*
- *"Dark psychological thrillers in Scandinavian languages"*
- *"Hidden gem sci-fi films from the 80s and 90s"*

**How Chat Lists Work:**
1. **Smart Parsing**: Extracts genres, moods, years, languages, and reference titles from your text
2. **Discovery Detection**: Recognizes "obscure", "popular", "mainstream", "under the radar" keywords
3. **Semantic Anchoring**: Uses "like [movie]" or "similar to [show]" for TF-IDF similarity matching
4. **Automatic Defaults**: Assumes English and mainstream content unless you specify otherwise
5. **Flexible Genre Matching**: Allows broader matches while respecting your intent

**Chat Features:**
- Natural language understanding (no complex syntax needed)
- Automatic mainstream bias for quality results
- Smart defaults for missing parameters
- Supports all filters: genre, mood, year, language, obscurity, media type
- Semantic similarity to reference titles

### Other SmartList Features
- **Dynamic Titles**: Netflix-style personalized titles like "Fans of Inception Also Enjoyed"
- **Watched Status Sync**: Automatically marks watched items from your Trakt history
- **Trakt Integration**: Two-way sync with your Trakt lists
- **Cooldown Management**: Smart sync timing prevents API rate limits

### üåç Content Discovery
- **~1.47 Million Pre-Loaded Titles**: Instant recommendations from TMDB CSV datasets (~1.3M movies + 165K shows)
- **Multi-Language Support**: Discover content in 20+ languages with smart fallback
- **Ultra Discovery Mode**: Find hidden gems and obscure titles
- **Genre Blending**: Mix multiple genres for unique recommendations

### ‚ö° Zero-Config Setup
- **Docker-First Architecture**: One command to start everything
- **Auto-Init Database**: Pre-populates ~1.47M candidates on first startup
- **Persistent Storage**: All data survives container restarts
- **Background Tasks**: Celery workers handle syncs and updates automatically

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (with Docker Compose)
- [Trakt](https://trakt.tv) account (free)
- [TMDB API Key](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) (free)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/steffenbb/WatchBuddy.git
cd watchbuddy

# Start all services
docker compose up -d

# Wait ~2 minutes for database initialization (first run only)
# Then open your browser to http://localhost:5173
```

That's it! WatchBuddy will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Create the database
- ‚úÖ Load ~1.47 million titles (~1.3M movies + 165K shows)
- ‚úÖ Start the API, frontend, Redis, and background workers
- ‚úÖ Initialize all required services

### Alternative Installation (no git clone)

Want to run WatchBuddy without cloning the repo? You can use Docker Compose directly:

Steps (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
# 1) Create a folder (optional) and enter it
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force .\watchbuddy | Out-Null; Set-Location .\watchbuddy

# 2) Download the compose file into this folder
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing \
    -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steffenbb/WatchBuddy/main/docker-compose.yml \
    -OutFile docker-compose.yml

# 3) Pull the required images
docker compose pull

# 4) Start the stack in the background
docker compose up -d

# 5) Open the app (after ~2 minutes on first run)
# http://localhost:5173
```

Handy commands:

```powershell
# Update to latest images and restart
docker compose pull; docker compose up -d

# Check status and recent logs
docker compose ps
docker logs --tail 100 watchbuddy-backend-1
docker logs --tail 100 watchbuddy-frontend-1

# Stop the stack (keep data)
docker compose down

# Reset everything (DESTRUCTIVE)
docker compose down -v
```

Notes:
- First startup seeds the database and may take a few minutes depending on your machine.
- Data is persisted in Docker volumes (PostgreSQL, Redis). Removing volumes resets the app.
- Configure Trakt OAuth and TMDB API key from the in-app Settings once the UI is up.

### First-Time Setup

1. **Open WatchBuddy**: Navigate to http://localhost:5173
2. **Connect Trakt**: 
    - Go to Settings ‚Üí Trakt Authentication
    - Click "Authorize with Trakt" and complete OAuth flow
3. **Add TMDB API Key**:
    - Get free API key from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)
    - Go to Settings ‚Üí TMDB API Key and save it
4. **Create Your First List**:
    - Click "Create SmartList"
    - Set filters (genre, mood, year, language)
    - Watch your personalized recommendations appear!

## üéØ How Recommendations Work

### The Scoring System

WatchBuddy uses a sophisticated multi-factor scoring algorithm to rank candidates. Every title gets a score from 0.0 to 1.0 based on:

#### **Base Quality Metrics** (40-50% weight)
- **TMDB Rating** (vote_average): Normalized 0-10 scale ‚Üí 0-1
- **Vote Count**: More votes = more reliable rating (logarithmic scaling)
- **Popularity**: TMDB popularity score indicates current interest

#### **Discovery Mode** (20-30% weight)
Different modes adjust how popularity affects scoring:
- **Mainstream/Popular**: Boosts high mainstream_score (popularity + votes + rating)
- **Obscure/Hidden Gems**: Boosts high obscurity_score (high rating, low popularity)
- **Balanced**: Equal weight to both mainstream and obscure content
- **Ultra Discovery**: Aggressive exploration of lesser-known titles

#### **Freshness Bonus** (5-15% weight)
Recent releases get a boost:
- Content <1 year old: +15% bonus
- Content 1-2 years old: +10% bonus
- Content 2-3 years old: +5% bonus
- Older content: No bonus

#### **Mood Matching** (10-20% weight for mood lists)
Mood vectors map to genres and themes:
- "Dark" ‚Üí boosts Thriller, Horror, Crime
- "Cozy" ‚Üí boosts Comedy, Romance, Family
- "Intense" ‚Üí boosts Action, Thriller, War
- Multiple moods blend together with configurable weights

#### **Semantic Similarity** (20-55% weight when anchor set)
For "like [movie]" queries:
- TF-IDF vectorization of title, overview, and genres
- Cosine similarity between anchor and candidate
- Higher weight (55%) for chat lists to prioritize good matches
- Lower weight (50%) for other lists to balance with other factors

#### **Trakt History Integration** (Dynamic)
- **Watched Penalty**: Already-watched items scored lower (or excluded entirely)
- **Rating Alignment**: Your Trakt ratings influence similar content scoring (future feature)
- **Genre Preference**: Your watch history informs genre weighting (future feature)

#### **Post-Processing Adjustments**
- **Animation/Family Penalty**: -8-10% when not explicitly requested (reduces kid content noise)
- **English Boost**: +5% for English content when language not specified (mainstream bias)
- **Duplicate Filtering**: Removes duplicates and recently shown items

### Score Calculation Example

For a candidate like "21 Jump Street" (2012):
```python
Base Score = 0.7  # Good rating (7.1/10), 5000+ votes, decent popularity

Discovery Adjustment:
  - Mainstream mode: +0.1 (high mainstream_score = 180)
  
Freshness:
  - Released 2012: 0.0 (>3 years old)

Semantic Similarity (if "like The Hangover"):
  - TF-IDF similarity: 0.65
  - Weight: 0.55 (chat list)
  - Contribution: 0.55 * 0.65 = 0.36

English Boost:
  - +0.05 (English content, no language filter)

Final Score = (0.45 * 0.7) + (0.55 * 0.65) + 0.05 = 0.73
```

This balanced approach ensures:
‚úÖ Quality content rises to the top
‚úÖ Discovery preferences are respected
‚úÖ Semantic matches are prioritized for "like X" queries
‚úÖ Fresh content gets visibility
‚úÖ Your watch history keeps recommendations relevant

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Creating SmartLists

SmartLists are dynamically generated based on your filters:

1. Click **"Create SmartList"** on the dashboard
2. Configure filters:
    - **Genres**: Select multiple (e.g., `Action`, `Sci-Fi`)
    - **Moods**: Choose up to 3 (`Dark`, `Tense`, `Quirky`)
    - **Languages**: Support for 20+ languages (`en`, `da`, `sv`, `no`, etc.)
    - **Year Range**: Filter by decade or specific years
    - **Obscurity**: Discover hidden gems vs mainstream hits
3. Set **Item Limit** (default: 200)
4. Click **"Sync"** to populate your list

### Syncing with Trakt

WatchBuddy automatically syncs with Trakt:

- **Watched Status**: Items you've watched on Trakt are marked automatically
- **Two-Way Sync**: Changes made in WatchBuddy update Trakt lists
- **Background Updates**: Celery Beat refreshes lists every 24 hours

### How Fetching and Enrichment Works (Plain-English)

- Preloaded pool: WatchBuddy ships with a large, preloaded database of titles so your lists build fast without waiting on external APIs.
- Offline-first syncs: Your SmartLists are created by querying the local database (language, genre, year, mood, etc.).
- Background enrichment: Extra details (artwork, overviews, mappings) are fetched in the background from TMDB/Trakt when available.
- Graceful failures: Some items don‚Äôt have perfect cross-service mappings (404s are normal). We keep those items and continue.
- Freshness: Recent titles get vote/popularity refreshed periodically so recommendations stay up to date.

### Managing Lists

- **Custom Lists**: Manually add specific titles
- **Edit Filters**: Modify SmartList criteria anytime and re-sync
- **Delete Lists**: Removes from both WatchBuddy and Trakt
- **Export**: Lists are automatically synced to your Trakt account

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

WatchBuddy works out-of-the-box, but you can customize via environment variables:

```bash
# docker-compose.override.yml (optional)
services:
  backend:
     environment:
        - LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG  # Default: INFO
  db:
     environment:
        - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=custom_password  # Default: watchbuddy
```

### Data Persistence

All data is stored in Docker volumes:
- `db_data_v2`: PostgreSQL database (lists, items, candidates)
- Redis (settings, cache, Celery queues)

To reset everything:
```bash
docker compose down -v  # WARNING: Deletes all data!
docker compose up -d
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Lists Not Syncing?
1. Check Trakt connection in Settings
2. Verify TMDB API key is valid
3. Look for errors in `docker logs watchbuddy-backend-1`

### Missing Recommendations?
- First startup takes ~2 minutes to load candidates

---

## üê≥ Docker: Local vs Server and Versioning

- Use `docker-compose.yml` for server/production; it points to published images (`lsdking101/*`).
- Use `docker-compose.override.yml` locally to build images from source while keeping server deploys clean.
- The override file is automatically picked up by `docker compose` when present locally and is ignored by remote builds via `.dockerignore`.

### CI Releases
- On pushes to `main`, GitHub Actions builds and pushes Docker images for backend and frontend with tags:
    - `latest`
    - date-based version (e.g., `v2025.10.15.123`)
    - short commit SHA
- Pushing a git tag like `v1.2.3` will use that semantic version for image tags.

Images include labels `org.opencontainers.image.version` and `org.opencontainers.image.revision`, and both Dockerfiles accept `APP_VERSION` and `GIT_SHA` build args.
- Check logs: `docker logs watchbuddy-backend-1 --tail 100`
- Try forcing a full sync: Click list ‚Üí "Sync" button

### Container Issues?
```bash
# Restart all services
docker compose restart

# Rebuild after code changes
docker compose build backend
docker compose up -d backend

# Check service health
docker compose ps
docker logs watchbuddy-backend-1
```

Edit `docker-compose.override.yml` if you want different local credentials. That file is added to `.gitignore` so it won't be committed.

IMPORTANT: this repository also includes an intentionally committed set of default DB credentials
to make the project work out-of-the-box for local development. These credentials are insecure
and MUST NOT be used in production. Rotate/change them before deploying or use a secrets manager.

## Persistent Candidate Pool Architecture

WatchBuddy now uses a **persistent database candidate pool** for fast recommendations without excessive API calls.

### Overview
- **`PersistentCandidate` table**: Stores movies/shows with metadata (genres, language, popularity, votes, obscurity/mainstream/freshness scores).
- **CSV Bootstrap**: On first startup, CSVs in `/app/data/*.csv` auto-import into the database (historical content up to 2023).
- **Incremental Ingestion**: Background Celery tasks fetch new content (>=2024) from TMDB/Trakt and insert into the pool.
- **Vote Refresh**: Recent items (<90 days) have their vote_count/vote_average periodically refreshed for accuracy.
- **Fast Queries**: SmartList syncs query the database with filters (language, genre, year, obscurity) instead of hitting external APIs repeatedly.

### CSV Dataset Placement
Place your TMDB CSV datasets (movies and shows) in `backend/data/` before building:
```bash
# Example structure:
# backend/data/TMDB_movies_dataset.csv
# backend/data/TMDB_shows_dataset.csv
```
Expected CSV columns (flexible matching):
- `tmdb_id` or `id` (required)
- `title` or `name` (required)
- `media_type` or `type` (optional, inferred from filename/context)
- `original_language` or `language`
- `popularity`, `vote_average`, `vote_count`
- `release_date` or `first_air_date`
- `genres` (JSON array or comma-separated)
- `keywords`, `overview`, `poster_path`, `backdrop_path` (optional)

On first run, `init_db()` detects an empty `persistent_candidates` table and imports these CSVs automatically.

### Celery Task Scheduling
The following background tasks maintain the candidate pool:

**Ingestion Tasks** (fetch new content >=2024):
- `ingest_new_movies` ‚Äì Discovers new movies from TMDB
- `ingest_new_shows` ‚Äì Discovers new shows from TMDB

**Vote Refresh Tasks** (update recent items):
- `refresh_recent_votes_movies` ‚Äì Refreshes vote stats for recent movies
- `refresh_recent_votes_shows` ‚Äì Refreshes vote stats for recent shows

#### Example Celery Beat Schedule
Add to your Celery configuration (e.g., `backend/app/core/celery_app.py` or environment):
```python
from celery.schedules import crontab

beat_schedule = {
    'ingest-new-movies': {
        'task': 'app.services.tasks.ingest_new_movies',
        'schedule': crontab(hour=2, minute=0),  # Daily at 2 AM
    },
    'ingest-new-shows': {
        'task': 'app.services.tasks.ingest_new_shows',
        'schedule': crontab(hour=3, minute=0),  # Daily at 3 AM
    },
    'refresh-votes-movies': {
        'task': 'app.services.tasks.refresh_recent_votes_movies',
        'schedule': crontab(hour=4, minute=0, day_of_week='0,3'),  # Twice a week
    },
    'refresh-votes-shows': {
        'task': 'app.services.tasks.refresh_recent_votes_shows',
        'schedule': crontab(hour=5, minute=0, day_of_week='0,3'),
    },
}
```

Or use Docker Compose environment variables to configure intervals (implementation-specific).

### Obscurity & Mainstream Scoring
The persistent pool pre-computes heuristic scores:
- **`obscurity_score`**: High rating with low vote_count/popularity = interesting obscure content
- **`mainstream_score`**: High rating + high popularity + high votes = mainstream hits
- **`freshness_score`**: Recency decay over 3 years for new content boost

These scores accelerate discovery mode filtering (obscure/popular/balanced) without re-computation.

### Manual CSV Import
If you need to manually import or update datasets after initial bootstrap:
```bash
docker exec -it watchbuddy-backend-1 python -m app.scripts.import_tmdb_csv /app/data/your_file.csv movie
```
