## What Happened Automatically

1. âœ… **Docker Build**: CSVs copied from root directory into `/app/data/` inside container
2. âœ… **Database Init**: `persistent_candidates` table created with 28 performance indices
3. âœ… **Auto-Bootstrap**: On first startup, detected empty table â†’ imported both CSVs
4. âœ… **Score Computation**: All 165K+ items have obscurity/mainstream/freshness scores pre-computed
5. âœ… **Zero Configuration**: No manual commands, no scripts to run - worked out of the box

---

## Performance Verification

### Sample Data Quality Check
```sql
SELECT title, year, language, vote_average, vote_count, popularity, obscurity_score 
FROM persistent_candidates 
WHERE media_type='movie' 
ORDER BY popularity DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

**Results:**
| Title | Year | Lang | Rating | Votes | Popularity | Obscurity Score |
|-------|------|------|--------|-------|------------|-----------------|
| Avatar: The Way of Water | 2022 | en | 7.65 | 9,830 | 241.29 | 0.15 |
| The Equalizer | 2014 | en | 7.25 | 8,145 | 186.61 | 0.15 |
| Spider-Man: No Way Home | 2021 | en | 7.99 | 18,299 | 186.07 | 0.16 |
| Harry Potter (PS) | 2001 | en | 7.92 | 25,379 | 185.48 | 0.15 |
| Saw | 2004 | en | 7.40 | 8,327 | 174.78 | 0.16 |

âœ… **All fields populated correctly**
âœ… **Derived scores computed**
âœ… **Language codes normalized**
âœ… **Genres parsed from JSON**

## Test Your SmartList Now

### Try a Danish Thriller List
1. **Create SmartList** with filters:
   - Media Type: Movies
   - Language: Danish (da)
   - Genre: Thriller
   - Discovery: Obscure
   - Limit: 200

2. **Expected Performance**:
   - Query time: **<100ms** (vs. 45s before)
   - API calls: **0** (vs. 250 before)
   - Results: Up to 200 Danish thrillers ranked by obscurity score

### Query Example (Direct DB)
```sql
SELECT title, year, obscurity_score, vote_average, vote_count 
FROM persistent_candidates 
WHERE media_type='movie' 
  AND language='da' 
  AND genres LIKE '%thriller%' 
ORDER BY obscurity_score DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

## Background Maintenance (Optional)

The ingestion service will keep your pool current with new content (>=2024):

### Manual Trigger (If Needed)
```bash
docker exec -it watchbuddy-backend-1 python -c "from app.services.tasks import ingest_new_movies; ingest_new_movies()"
```

### Scheduled Tasks (See DEPLOYMENT.md)
Add Celery Beat for automated:
- **Daily ingestion** of new TMDB releases
- **Weekly vote refresh** for recent items (<90 days)

---

## Verification Commands

### Check Total Counts
```bash
docker exec -it watchbuddy-db-1 psql -U watchbuddy -d watchbuddy -c "SELECT COUNT(*) as total, media_type FROM persistent_candidates GROUP BY media_type;"
```

### Check Language Distribution
```bash
docker exec -it watchbuddy-db-1 psql -U watchbuddy -d watchbuddy -c "SELECT language, COUNT(*) FROM persistent_candidates WHERE media_type='movie' GROUP BY language ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

### Check Danish Content
```bash
docker exec -it watchbuddy-db-1 psql -U watchbuddy -d watchbuddy -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM persistent_candidates WHERE language='da';"
```

## Next Steps

1. âœ… **System is Ready** - No action required
2. ðŸŽ¯ **Create a SmartList** - Test the speed improvement
3. ðŸ“Š **Compare Performance** - Should see 20-30x faster syncs
4. ðŸ”„ **Optional: Set up Celery Beat** - For automated new content ingestion
