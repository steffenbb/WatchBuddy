## üÜï What‚Äôs New (Oct 2025)

- Persistent-only list syncs: Syncs now read exclusively from the internal database for speed and reliability.
- Background ingestion workers: Run every 2 hours (~12 minutes) using TMDB Search (multi) to discover new titles; resolves Trakt IDs by TMDB ID when possible.
- System Health widget: Shows Movie/TV ingestion worker status (Running/Completed/Error), last/next run times, and items processed.
- Trakt list creation:
	- Custom, Suggested, and Smart lists create a corresponding Trakt list at creation time (if authenticated)
	- Initial items are pushed to Trakt during the first population task (within seconds of creation)

If your Trakt list is missing or empty after creation:
- Check Settings ‚Üí Trakt, ensure you‚Äôre authenticated
- Check System Health ‚Üí Trakt API ‚ÄúOnline‚Äù
- Wait 10‚Äì60 seconds for initial population to push items; then refresh
- Use ‚ÄúSync‚Äù on the list to retry
